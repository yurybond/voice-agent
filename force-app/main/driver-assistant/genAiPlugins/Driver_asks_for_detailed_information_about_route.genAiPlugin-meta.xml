        <description>Define the needed route by using  data from &apos;RouteDataServiceList&apos; action, use &apos;Contact&apos; context variable value as &apos;Contact&apos; input parameter for  &apos;RouteDataServiceList&apos; action and respond with information about that route strictly in the following format:
Your upcoming/next/last delivery is scheduled to start on ROUTE_START_NAME from FULL_ADRESS_OF_FIRST_STOP to CITY_OF_LAST_STOP with NUMBER_OF_INTERMEDIATE_STOPS intermediate stop in CITY_NAMES_OF_INTERMEDIATE_STOPS.
where ROUTE_START_NAME is start time of founded route strictly in format like &quot;Monday, February 3rd at 12:00&quot; or use &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;today&quot; , &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;next monday&quot; if possible.
where FULL_ADRESS_OF_FIRST_STOP is a full address of first stop of founded route
where CITY_OF_LAST_STOP is a city of address of the last point
where NUMBER_OF_INTERMEDIATE_STOPS   is a number of intermediate stops. You should exclude the first and the last stop from the number of intermediate stops.
CITY_NAMES_OF_INTERMEDIATE_STOPS is information about intermediate stops with city names only, you should use only city names for intermediate stops without street names
An example of this response would be: &quot;Your next route is Monday, February 3rd at 12:00 from 11th Ave. 33, New York to Chicago with 1 stop in between in Boston.&quot;
Your response should be brief and easy to pronounce.

Take route start date and end date into consideration to identify completed, current and upcoming routes. Dates have higher priority than status.

1. Define upcoming route where &apos;expectedArrivalStartTime&apos; or &apos;&apos; from &apos;RouteDataServiceList&apos; action equal or more than today and &apos;status&apos; is &apos;New&apos;. Display it in format: 
&lt;ORIGIN CITY&gt; &lt;DESTINATION CITY&gt; &lt;STATUS&gt;  &lt;expectedArrivalStartTime&gt;
2. Define current route where today date is between route start date and route end date.  Display it in format: 
&lt;ORIGIN CITY&gt; &lt;DESTINATION CITY&gt; &lt;STATUS&gt;  &lt;DELIVERY DATE EXPECTED&gt;
3. Define delivered route where &apos;status&apos; is &apos;Delivered&apos; from &apos;RouteDataServiceList&apos;. Display it in format: 
&lt;ORIGIN CITY&gt; &lt;DESTINATION CITY&gt;  &lt;DELIVERY DATE ACTUAL&gt;
4. Define past route where &apos;expectedDepartureTime&apos;  or &apos;actualDepartureTime&apos; dates from &apos;RouteDataServiceList&apos; action in the past and the status does not matter. Display it in format: 
&lt;ORIGIN CITY&gt; &lt;DESTINATION CITY&gt; &lt;STATUS&gt; &lt;DELIVERY DATE [Actual or Expected]&gt;
5. Define in progress route where &apos;status&apos; is &apos;In-Progress&apos; from &apos;RouteDataServiceList&apos; action. 
Display it in format: &lt;ORIGIN CITY&gt; &lt;DESTINATION CITY&gt; &lt;DELIVERY DATE [Actual or Expected]&gt;</description>
